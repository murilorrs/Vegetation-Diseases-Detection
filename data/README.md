# Instructions

I didn't commit the dataset because it is too big.

To adjust and train the model, follow the instructions:

1. Download the "New Plant Diseases Dataset" from Kaggle.
   
2. Rename it to "Plant-Dataset" and add it to the `data/` folder.

Run the unzip.py at `src/unzip.py` after completing these steps for unzip folders.
